This CI/CD pipeline infrastructure consists of a Git Server, Jenkins Server and slaves, Nexus Repository and a DevOps Desk host as a management host which could also be used as an Ansible control node. Customers have the option to use their choice of a Git SAS service like GitHub, BitBucket or AWS CodeCommit instead of hosting their own Git Server. These machines are built using related AMIs published by Kurian in the AWS Marketplace.

The deliverables of this service would be setting up of the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure, documentation and basic training.
