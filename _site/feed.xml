Here’s why this part of the process is so important if you want to outperform the competition.</p>

<h2 id="success-is-a-marathon-not-a-sprint">Success is a Marathon, Not a Sprint</h2>

<p>Let’s imagine you’re sitting at home one day, idly scrolling through Instagram when you come across an advert for a race. A <strong>huge cash prize</strong> awaits whoever can make it over the finish line first. </p>

<p>It’s caught your attention, but there’s a problem: The other applicants are marathon veterans, and you don’t have the skills or experience necessary to beat them to the finish line. <br />
But you’re not going to let it pass you by that easily. So, you decide to hire an <strong>experienced runner</strong> to enter in your place.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=24" alt="" /></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://gifer.com/de/user/361565">Kazrazragore</a> on Gifer</p>

<p>Now, you might be reading this thinking “But I’m not running anywhere. I want a top-of-class product that helps me hit my business goals.”, and we hear you. That’s more <a href="https://xwp.co/services/">our wheelhouse</a> too. But the two scenarios are actually very similar: </p>

<p>To launch a successful digital product (or win a marathon), requires specific expertise, dedicated resources, and, perhaps most importantly, <strong>thorough planning</strong>. Add to that the competition of other enterprise-level businesses at the top of their game, and creating a solution in-house becomes <em>very</em> time-consuming and <em>very</em> expensive.</p>

<p>Luckily, this is where agencies like XWP can help, by providing <a href="https://xwp.co/about/team/">experienced product professionals</a> who can plan and run the race for you. But in order to give them the best chance of success, there are a few foundational steps they need to take before the big day.</p>

<p>Here’s why a thorough discovery process is crucial to producing successful digital products that serve your business and teams effectively.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=12" alt="A magnifying glass looking for a runner, with split-out points that show their credentials." /></p>

<h2 id="finding-your-champion">Finding Your Champion</h2>

<p>So, let’s quickly jump back into our fictional race for the big cash prize.</p>

<p>You take your time to weigh up your options and finally land on partnering with a local athlete, <strong>Lightning Colt.</strong> Colt has had a lot of success running similar races in the past, and you’re confident that he’s got the experience, knowledge, and skills necessary to win.</p>

<p>You tell him that the marathon is 26.2 miles long, and given his recent performances, he estimates that he should be able to run that in a little over two hours. On paper, it’s enough to snag you the win. Great!</p>

<p>But running a race of this caliber isn’t straightforward: Colt’s diet, activities, and rest are all going to be important—and he’s going to need water, energy bars and equipment for the day itself. Already, there are a few things that you’re going to have to look into before training begins. </p>

<p>In product development, these initial conversations before we dig further into the details, are what we call <strong>pre-discovery,</strong> and are usually carried out as part of the sales process<strong>.</strong> </p>

<p>Pre-discovery is where you have the chance to discuss what you’re looking for at a high level. What is the goal of the project, what limitations might there be (such as timeframes and existing setups), and ultimately, is the work possible?</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=13" alt="Binoculars with A and B on each lense." /></p>

<h2 id="okay-im-ready-lets-get-this-race-going">Okay, I’m Ready. Let’s Get This Race Going! </h2>

<p>Woah, Woah! Let’s just take a minute. It’s understandable to be excited at the prospect of truckloads of cash arriving at your doorstep (we would be too), but we need to properly plan our approach.</p>

<p>At this point, you’ve got an experienced runner prepared to enter on your behalf and help you win, but they’re still missing a number of key details—including a proper visualization of the goal.<br />
To remedy this, you take Colt to the start point and ask him to look into the horizon where the Finish line is. He squints into the distance, just about making out the flags. <em>“If you can make it over there in 2 hours or less, then we’ve won!”</em></p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=4" alt="" /></p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://giphy.com/channel/polyvinylrecords">polyvinylrecords</a> on Giphy</p>

<p><strong>Colt now knows where point A and point B are, and he’s aware of the timeframe for success. So he should be good to go.</strong> <strong><em>Right?</em></strong> </p>

<p>Well, not exactly. Marathons (much like product development) are complicated—especially if you’re trying to beat the competition.</p>

<p>To give Colt the best chance of success, he’s going to need to know everything that will give him an edge over other runners—and how do we account for everything that happens in <em>between</em> point A and point B? </p>

<p>Similar questions need to be asked when approaching an agency for website development. It’s normal to have a goal in mind, but there are usually a lot of contextual factors that need to be considered before any development begins.</p>

<p>Say for example your current hosting provider doesn’t support the features you want, or your ideas present a security risk for your user data. These things need to be identified early, as they will shape the course of development and what a solution ultimately looks like.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=3" alt="" /></p>

<p>“The technical expertise that XWP was providing really put us at ease. It wasn’t just us asking for things to be done, but the team feeding back to us saying ‘hey, we’ve thought about this, ‘hey, we’ve thought about that.’”</p>

<p><strong>**Sebastian Pertosi</strong>**, Head of Marketing, <a href="https://www.ofx.com/en-au/">OFX</a></p>

<p>True partners won’t just say “yes” to ideas that have no return on your goals or will cause problems elsewhere—after all, they will want you to succeed as much as you do! Instead, they’ll work with you to understand your core business goals, and create a solution that’s sustainable, secure, and successful. </p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=2" alt="A map showing two points, point A and point B." /></p>

<h2 id="its-not-just-point-a-to-point-b">It’s Not Just Point A to Point B</h2>

<p>Back in our fictional race for money and fame, you begin the process of learning everything that can be done to ensure that Colt is properly prepared to win the race.</p>

<p>To do this, he has to understand the journey to the end goal. This will allow him to strategize his focus throughout the race, and figure out where he can put some distance in between himself and the competition.</p>

<p><strong>But how can Colt understand the journey without actually running the race?</strong></p>

<p>Colt mentions that a map of the course would help him plan out when he’s going to turn up the pressure, and which sections he can use to conserve energy.</p>

<p><strong>But what if no one has yet created a map that is detailed enough with all of the information?</strong></p>

<p>Then we need to start a <strong>discovery</strong> reconnaissance mission, to explore the road and its terrain to understand what exists between the start and finish line. We also need to look into other factors that might affect him on the day such as the weather, the wind or sun or rain or storm and so he can prepare for any scenario.</p>

<p>In the product development world, this relates to an incredibly crucial step, where performance-focused engineers dig into your existing architecture to gain a full and thorough understanding of how your site or product currently works.</p>

<p>Missing this step can have dramatic ramifications down the road, and allows those doing the work to understand where the biggest opportunities lie.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=14" alt="The route from the previous map, with an exclamation point that shows an obstacle along the way." /></p>

<h2 id="mapping-the-route">Mapping the Route</h2>

<p>When you go out with Colt to create the journey map, you discover that the race isn’t actually as simple as ‘Point A to Point B’. </p>

<p>Having never traversed the course of the race, you didn’t realize there were hilly sections, you hadn’t anticipated a large section of boggy sand towards the end of the course, and you realized you hadn’t yet factored in the potential of how each of those risks increases in bad weather.</p>

<p>These are obstacles, and although Colt is still confident he can reach the finish line, he will now need to change his training to account for them, with limited time left until race day.</p>

<p>In the world of web design and digital products, we would call this <strong>risk management</strong> and <strong>project road mapping</strong>.</p>

<p>Similar to checking the weather forecast for the race, this is the process where development and launch risks are outlined, and it’s decided how, and when, key features of the product are going to be built. Whenever possible, this is always planned within the confines of the requested time frame.</p>

<p>By doing this at the beginning, you are able to put safety nets around risky parts of the product development cycle and ensure proper processes are put in place to deal with anything that might go wrong.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=15" alt="A silhouette of the runner, along with all the things that factor into their success: energy, health, nutrition, etc." /></p>

<h2 id="running-with-a-dedicated-team">Running With a Dedicated Team</h2>

<p>All of this is shaping up to be quite the workload. </p>

<p>Where you had envisioned a simple engagement with Colt for him to run the race for you, you are now having to consider things like risk management, mapping the course, and analyzing the competition.</p>

<p><strong>It’s a lot. But let’s imagine for a second that Colt had his own team. How do things change?</strong> </p>

<p>He’d still be the one to run, but he now has a licensed nutritionist on-hand to help plan his diet, an ex-olympian coach who could help manage his progress, a world-class physical therapist to aid in his rest and recovery cycle, and a partnership with a top sports brand—who provide him with the best supplements on the market.</p>

<p>The price would be more expensive than working with a Colt by himself, but his chances of success are improved <strong>dramatically</strong>.</p>

<p>A jack of all trades is often the master of none, and having to help with risk management and mapping the course only distracts him from his training. Now, you have access to a team of experienced professionals, each of whom is well-versed in training and managing runners for successful marathon wins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’ll now meet with the coach, who will update you frequently on Colt’s progress and keep driving the project towards success.</li>
  <li>The physical therapist will make sure Colt is in the best shape possible to tackle that hard-to-cross boggy section of the race.</li>
  <li>The nutritionist will help keep Colt’s diet on track, giving you the piece of mind that he’ll have enough energy on the day.</li>
  <li>The sports partner will provide everything he needs on the day.</li>
  <li>This means Colt can now focus on training, and keeping his mind firmly on the task in hand.</li>
  <li>And you’re still a key part of the process, meeting with the coach regularly to discuss Colt’s progress and voicing any concerns you might have. </li>
</ul>

<p>What’s more, they’ll do each of those tasks with a <strong>careers-worth of experience</strong>.</p>

<p>And this is exactly how product development works with a trusted agency. </p>

<p>Because agencies work on multiple projects at any given time, they have the workload to sustain having highly-experienced product specialists and engineers that can be brought into your project when necessary, in areas where their expertise is most useful.</p>

<p>Working with Colt alone, you had a goal. Working with his full team, you had a goal, and a well-shaped plan on how to achieve it.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=16" alt="A trophy on a podium." /></p>

<h2 id="race-day">Race Day</h2>

<p>The big day is finally here. Colt and the rest of his team are all at “point A” while you eagerly wait for the starting klaxon to sound.</p>

<p>Over the next hour, Colt enacts the plan laid out by his coach. Conserving energy when running through the hilly sections, and upping the pace in the flat sections. The amateur runners in the race are already far behind, and only three other professional entrants still pose a threat.</p>

<p>The first entrant gets a cramp, and begins to lag behind. He did his own physio by watching YouTube videos, and ends up finishing in fifth place.</p>

<p>The second hadn’t studied the route in-depth, and began to run out of energy after powering through the hilly sections at full-steam. After re-cooperation time, he finishes amongst the faster amateur racers.</p>

<p>The final runner competes with Colt in a fierce battle until the last 30 minutes of the race. That’s when heavy rain starts to make the boggy section of the course even more of a challenge.</p>

<p>Luckily for Colt, the team had planned for the risk of adverse weather, and his equipment partner had provided him with some running shoes capable of dealing with the softer ground. His opponent’s team did not calculate for that same risk, resulting in them being slowed to a grinding halt only 1 mile from the finish line.</p>

<p>Because your team went through a thorough discovery process, fully mapping the landscape of the challenge, taking time to put risk prevention measures in place, and giving Colt everything he needed to succeed, he finished in 1 hour and 58 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>The big cash prize is officially yours.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=1" alt="The route, in front of a UI screen and a bag of money. This image ties together the success in the race, and in product development." /></p>

<p>Your mission has been a resounding success because you leveraged the expertise and experience of a team dedicated to planning a smooth and successful race, and whilst it did require a greater financial investment, you were able to achieve your desired outcome.</p>

<p>Now imagine that Colt is your website, and the other professionals were your main competitors. </p>

<p>What would the race have looked like if you didn’t take the time to create a thorough plan, or work with a team of trusted advisors? </p>

<p>We can’t answer that last question for you, but one thing we can say is that at XWP we plan for success, and we’d prefer not to run the race until we have everything we need for you to win it!</p>

<h2 id="the-break-down">The Break-Down</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Discovery is a crucial part of digital product development.</li>
  <li>It enables agency teams to fully understand your goals, and craft a solution that properly meets them whilst accounting for any risks.</li>
  <li>Moving straight into the development of a product without undergoing discovery opens your product up to significant risks along the way, and may even result in a product that damages your reputation.</li>
  <li>An experienced agency advisor will never undertake work without undergoing discovery first.</li>
  <li>Working with an agency to undergo discovery means that you are able to leverage a range of different skill sets without the need for hiring internally— a process that is incredibly time-consuming and expensive.</li>
  <li>In this post, we liken agency discovery to hiring an experienced marathon runner and their team to compete in a race for you, breaking down how the discovery process directly contributes to success.</li>

<p>WordPress development used to be mostly about writing PHP and sometimes adding in sprinkles of JavaScript. But since 5.0, you can now rarely talk about WordPress development <em>without</em> mentioning JavaScript or more specifically <strong>React</strong>, the JavaScript library which the Block Editor is written in. So is learning React necessary for Block development?</p>

<p>And the answer is… It depends.</p>

<p>There are two approaches to Block development:</p>

<h2 id="gutenberg-block-development-using-php">Gutenberg Block Development Using PHP</h2>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=9" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first is lean towards PHP. This usually involves using third party solutions like <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/">Advanced Custom Fields</a> or <a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-blocks/">Meta Box Blocks</a> that serve as a framework for you to create custom blocks in a way which you’re already comfortable with. Despite having their own system, there are still some similarities to how native WordPress handles things like block registration. For example, Advanced Custom Fields recommends and supports the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block.json</code> for configuring your block.</p>

<p>Here’s a simplified example of creating a testimonial block using the ACF framework (code taken and simplified from <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/"></a><a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/">https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/</a>)</p>

<p>.wp-block-code {
	border: 0;
	padding: 0;
}</p>

<p>.wp-block-code &gt; div {
	overflow: auto;
}</p>

<p>.shcb-language {
	border: 0;
	clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
	-webkit-clip-path: inset(50%);
	clip-path: inset(50%);
	height: 1px;
	margin: -1px;
	overflow: hidden;
	padding: 0;
	position: absolute;
	width: 1px;
	word-wrap: normal;
	word-break: normal;
}</p>

<p>.hljs {
	box-sizing: border-box;
}</p>

<p>.hljs.shcb-code-table {
	display: table;
	width: 100%;
}</p>

<p>.hljs.shcb-code-table &gt; .shcb-loc {
	color: inherit;
	display: table-row;
	width: 100%;
}</p>

<p>.hljs.shcb-code-table .shcb-loc &gt; span {
	display: table-cell;
}</p>

<p>.wp-block-code code.hljs:not(.shcb-wrap-lines) {
	white-space: pre;
}</p>

<p>.wp-block-code code.hljs.shcb-wrap-lines {
	white-space: pre-wrap;
}</p>

<p>.hljs.shcb-line-numbers {
	border-spacing: 0;
	counter-reset: line;
}</p>

<p>.hljs.shcb-line-numbers &gt; .shcb-loc {
	counter-increment: line;
}</p>

<p>.hljs.shcb-line-numbers .shcb-loc &gt; span {
	padding-left: 0.75em;
}</p>

<p>.hljs.shcb-line-numbers .shcb-loc::before {
	border-right: 1px solid #ddd;
	content: counter(line);
	display: table-cell;
	padding: 0 0.75em;
	text-align: right;
	-webkit-user-select: none;
	-moz-user-select: none;
	-ms-user-select: none;
	user-select: none;
	white-space: nowrap;
	width: 1%;
}</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{     "name": "acf/testimonial",     "title": "Testimonial",     "description": "A custom testimonial block.",     "style": [ "file:./testimonial.css" ],     "category": "formatting",     "icon": "admin-comments",     "keywords": ["testimonial", "quote"],     "acf": {         "mode": "preview",         "renderTemplate": "testimonial.php"     },     "align": "full" }</code></p>

<p>Code language: JSON / JSON with Comments (json)</p>

<p><strong>/blocks/testimonials/block.json</strong></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;?php   /**  * Registering your block using the native register_block_type function.  */ add_action( 'init', 'register_acf_blocks' ); function register_acf_blocks() {     register_block_type( __DIR__ . '/blocks/testimonial' ); }</code></p>

<p>Code language: HTML, XML (xml)</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;?php /**  * testimonial.php - block template  */  // Load values and assign defaults. $text   = get_field( 'testimonial' ) ?: 'Your testimonial here...'; $author = get_field( 'author' ) ?: 'Author name';  ?&gt;  &lt;div&gt; 	&lt;blockquote class="testimonial-blockquote"&gt; 		&lt;span class="testimonial-text"&gt;&lt;?php echo esc_html( $text );?&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 		&lt;span class="testimonial-author"&gt;&lt;?php echo esc_html( $author );?&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 	&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<p>Code language: HTML, XML (xml)</p>

<p>The most obvious benefit with this approach is how quick and easy it is to get up and running; you don’t have to worry about things like tooling or package management in order to start creating custom blocks.</p>

<p>It’s also worth mentioning that plugins like Advanced Custom Fields are very popular in the WordPress ecosystem. For some, those plugins are part of their ‘tech stack’ when building WordPress sites. Hence this “low barrier to entry” solution is especially popular among seasoned WordPress and PHP developers because you’re leveraging an already familiar API to do something new.</p>

<p>With this approach, you’ll be predominantly working with PHP; there’s very little need, if any at all, for JavaScript, let alone React.</p>

<p>So if you choose this route then no, it’s not necessary to learn React for Block development.</p>

<p>But the idea of adding another third party dependency or framework, especially for doing something that is fundamental to WordPress is a deal-breaker for many. Lack of future-proofing and incompatibilities are some valid reasons to stay away from them and stick closely to doing things the “WordPress Way”.</p>

<p>This brings us to the second approach.</p>

<h2 id="gutenberg-block-development-using-javascript">Gutenberg Block Development Using JavaScript</h2>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=10" alt="" /></p>

<p>Or rather mostly JavaScript. Like many other things in WordPress you can’t avoid writing PHP. In most cases though, we’re talking about minimal involvement i.e., for enqueuing scripts or registering blocks on the server-side. Apart from that, it’s JavaScript all the way down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s worth mentioning for dynamic blocks, depending on its complexity there could be quite a bit of PHP required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But because it’s JavaScript and React, two terms that aren’t synonymous with WordPress development until a few years ago, the barrier to entry is high; getting your local environment setup can sometimes be a mini-project by itself; tooling and configurations can be very daunting and it’s possible to spend hours on them before you get to write the first line of code for your block. Also, not everyone has the luxury of time to get up to speed with React and its ecosystem.</p>

<p>So why is this still a viable and, in most cases, the recommended approach?</p>

<p>Security, performance and future-proofing, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Since we are using the API provided by WordPress Core, we can be sure that they are widely tested and optimized for a more superior editing experience. Having one less third-party solution also means you’re less likely to encounter compatibility issues; the “WordPress Way” is also continually evolving and improving so sticking to it helps ensure your codebase remains up-to-date.</p>

<p>So does this mean it’s necessary to learn React for this approach? Again, it depends.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to create basic blocks with minimal settings then you <strong>don’t need to learn React</strong>. But having a <strong>cursory understanding</strong> of concepts like state, components and the JSX syntax does is very useful. And the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/create-block/">Block Editor handbook</a> is a good resource to help with that.</p>

<p>(simplified code taken from <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/create-block/">Create a Block Tutorial</a>)</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{     "$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/block.json",     "apiVersion": 2,     "name": "create-block/gutenpride",     "version": "0.1.0",     "title": "Gutenpride",     "category": "widgets",     "icon": "smiley",     "description": "Example static block scaffolded with Create Block tool.",     "attributes": {         "message": {             "type": "string",             "source": "text",             "selector": "div",             "default": ""         }     },     "textdomain": "gutenpride" }</code></p>

<p>Code language: JSON / JSON with Comments (json)</p>

<p><strong>block.json</strong></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/**  * Edit.js  */  import { TextControl } from '@wordpress/components'; import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';  export default function Edit( { attributes, setAttributes } ) {     const blockProps = useBlockProps();     return (         &lt;TextControl             { ...blockProps }             value={ attributes.message }             onChange={ ( val ) =&gt; setAttributes( { message: val } ) }         /&gt;     ); }</code></p>

<p>Code language: JavaScript (javascript)</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/**  * Save.js  */  import { useBlockProps } from '@wordpress/block-editor';  export default function save( { attributes } ) {     const blockProps = useBlockProps.save();     return &lt;div { ...blockProps }&gt;{ attributes.message }&lt;/div&gt;; }</code></p>

<p>Code language: JavaScript (javascript)</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=21" alt="Inserting our “Simple Block” into the editor" /></p>

<p>Inserting our “Simple Block” into the editor</p>

<p>For more advanced blocks that involve the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-data/">WordPress’ data module</a> or working with external data sources then yes, you <strong>should learn React.</strong> As the complexity of your block increases, chances are you will have to dig deeper into concepts like state management, lifecycle and hooks to help with debugging, avoiding common pitfalls (like the <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/solve-react-useeffect-hook-infinite-loop-patterns/">infinite loop in useEffect</a>) and ensuring the end product works as intended.</p>

<p>On top of that, getting familiar with <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>, the state management library which the WordPress’ data module is inspired by, is also beneficial and important. And that because you’ll likely find yourself reaching out to the WordPress data store for things like getting the parent’s block client ID or all nested blocks inside a parent block.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/**  * Using the WordPress data module to retrieve information of parent and nested blocks  */  export default function Edit( props ) { 	// code removed for brevity  	// Selects nested Accordion-item blocks and index of each Accordion-item block. 	const { blockIDs, itemIndex } = useSelect( ( select ) =&gt; { 		// Gets ID of Accordion Parent block 		const parentOfSelectedBlock = select( 			'core/block-editor' 		).getBlockRootClientId( clientId );  		// Gets all nested Accordion item blocks. 		const blocksList = select( 'core/block-editor' ).getBlocks( 			parentOfSelectedBlock 		);  		return { 			blockIDs: blocksList.map( ( b ) =&gt; b.clientId ), 			itemIndex: select( 'core/block-editor' ).getBlockIndex( 				clientId, 				parentOfSelectedBlock 			), 		}; 	} );  	// code removed for brevity }</code></p>

<p>Code language: JavaScript (javascript)</p>

<p>Knowing React is also incredibly helpful in understanding the Gutenberg source code to see how things are being done the “WordPress Way”. For instance, the core Button block has a nice little feature for improving accessibility. When you click on the “Link” block control, a popover appears and the focus automatically shifts to the input field.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=22" alt="" /></p>

<p>Clicking on the same control again will cause the Button to be unlinked. At the same time, the focus automatically shifts back to the Button input. This nicety is achieved using refs in React.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=23" alt="" /></p>

<p>Improving accessibility by auto enabling focus on the button after the popover closes.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/**  * Simplified RichText Component using the forwardRef React API to receive the ref from its parent and forward it to a child component (&lt;TagName /&gt;)  */   function RichTextWrapper(props, forwardedRef) {     return (         &lt;TagName              ref={ useMergeRefs( [                 forwardedRef,                 ...otherRefs,             ] ) } // is this the correct syntax for spreading in array?             {...otherProps}         /&gt;     ) } const ForwardedRichTextContainer = forwardRef( RichTextWrapper );  export default ForwardedRichTextContainer;</code></p>

<p>Code language: JavaScript (javascript)</p>

<p>The above is just one of the many examples of how knowing React allows you to not only handle complex blocks but also provide a better editing experience when users use your block.</p>

<h3 id="services-provided">Services Provided</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Product &amp; Engineering Discovery</li>
  <li>Custom Plugin Development</li>
  <li>User Focused Design</li>
  <li>Ongoing Support</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Our partner promotes products through broadcasts on its brand-owned channels. Their team wanted to provide an easy way for viewers to access those products directly, without having to leave the stream to search for them.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> XWP’s design and development expertise to create a WordPress-powered stream extension, paired with <a href="https://wpengine.com/partners/agencies/xwp/">WP Engine</a>’s fully managed WordPress hosting platform</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Our team created a WordPress-powered extension built to our partner’s internal specifications, allowing viewers to browse featured product listings directly from the live stream. It premiered on-stream to an audience of more than 58,000 viewers. </p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=5" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="working-with-the-worlds-largest-livestream-platform">Working With The World’s Largest Livestream Platform</h2>

<p>Our partner is the world’s largest and most popular live streaming platform, with streams covering everything from gaming and music to arts and “in real life” streams.</p>

<p>Average combined viewership on the platform is over 2.5 Million at any given moment, with as many as 8 million unique creators streaming each month, more than 31 million average daily visitors, and more than 1.3 trillion minutes of streams watched in 2021.</p>

<h3 id="new-partnerships-new-reach">New Partnerships, New Reach</h3>

<p>On one of their brand channels, our partners review and suggest products live on stream. This is primarily done through an interactive variety show with entertainment segments and shoppable items from sponsored brands.</p>

<p>These broadcasts opened the door to new opportunities to work with brands to design bespoke game show-esque segments and provide a new way for them to authentically connect with online communities and showcase their products.</p>

<p>Sensing an opportunity to take these broadcasts to the next level, our partners got in touch with our team. They wanted to craft an easily manageable but highly customizable extension that would allow their web team to quickly and easily load product listings in real-time. The launch date was set in line with an upcoming promotional event being held by their main retail partner.</p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=6" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="building-a-custom-wordpress-powered-solution">Building a Custom WordPress-Powered Solution</h2>

<p>After a thorough and highly collaborative <a href="https://xwp.co/why-discovery-is-crucial-to-winning-the-race/">discovery process</a>, our team of performance experts created a stream extension (built to our partner’s internal guidelines), managed by a WordPress-powered backend, that features a number of truly powerful integrations.</p>

<p>Through the new WordPress-managed backend, our partner’s web teams are able to prepare product collections and customize how they display on the in-stream overlay. Product collections will then be presented on stream as carousels.</p>

<p>As part of the package, we also installed an analytics panel that allowed web teams to obtain data on clicks of the carousel. This means they can constantly improve their output by reviewing and optimizing their listings for future broadcasts. This was paired with extensive documentation and video walkthroughs from our team that enable anybody to get to grips with the new tool quickly. </p>

<p>The entire shopping extension package was delivered with a tight deadline, so that we could launch in time for a large annual promotion at our partner’s main retail partners—but that didn’t mean the finished product was any less robust. All deliverables underwent extensive QA testing from XWP’s in-house team, including load tests of up to 750k concurrent users with no issues and a simulated test with 1 million users which passed with flying colors.</p>

<h2 id="truly-powerful-integrations">Truly Powerful Integrations</h2>

<h3 id="product-integrations">Product Integrations</h3>

<p>We also built a custom solution that allows our partners to import product listings from multiple Amazon markets (Amazon Aus, Amazon US, Amazon BR, etc.) through Direct integration with <a href="https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/search-items.html">Amazon’s product listing API</a>.</p>

<p>This allows our partner’s web staff to input Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs). These unique blocks of 10 letters and/or numbers are used to identify items, creating a seamless experience for viewers that choose to purchase promoted products through the platform and giving them the freedom to market to stream viewers in new regions as the product evolves.</p>

<p>But perhaps one of the most valuable parts of this is that the web team doesn’t have to manually add products during the stream. Instead, attributes such as product data, images, availability, URL and price can be fetched automatically—they even refresh for the latest data every few minutes, saving valuable time and reducing the risk of human error.</p>

<p>But of course, not all product partnerships will be with Amazon-based retailers, so, our team maintained the ability for our partner’s internal teams to manually create product listings in the case they exist on a third-party site.</p>

<h3 id="technical-integrations">Technical Integrations</h3>

<p>Like everything we do at XWP, <a href="https://xwp.co/the-four-pillars-of-website-performance/">performance</a> was kept central to our vision for the solution. By working with WP Engine, we were able to easily provide a boost to backend performance through some clever technical integrations.</p>

<p>The first was WP Engine’s <a href="https://wpengine.com/support/performance-monitoring-faq/">Application Performance Monitoring</a>, which provides code-level visibility required for web teams to troubleshoot problems more quickly, optimize the WordPress experience, and develop the most agile, performant extension possible.</p>

<p>We also integrated the WordPress back end with <a href="https://wpengine.com/support/smart-plugin-manager/">Smart Plugin Manager</a> to keep plugins up to date while also ensuring those updates don’t negatively impact the end-user experience. </p>

<p><img src="https://picsum.photos/1600/900?v=8" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="outstanding-results--a-lasting-impact-on-streaming">Outstanding Results &amp; A Lasting Impact on Streaming</h2>

<p>We launched the extension live to an audience of 58,000 viewers—and it worked perfectly! The WP Engine-hosted custom WordPress backend was well-received by our partner’s web team, who had played a crucial role throughout the product definition and building phases.</p>

<p>One of the biggest results of this project was the potential impact it could have on the live-streaming industry. With almost 548 billion hours of live stream content <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1285501/global-time-spent-live-streaming-apps/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20global%20users%20have,from%20users%20worldwide%20in%202021.">being viewed each year</a>, the shopping extension represents the first exploration of an entirely new form of interactivity—pairing large engaged streaming communities with high-relevancy brands and products. </p>

<p>Now, content creators are able to more easily provide their growing audience with links to relevant products without interrupting the streaming experience, and do so safely and securely thanks to team XWP and WP Engine.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[write_a_description_around_160_characters_long_about_this_POST]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/seo/posts/post-a/city-a.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/seo/posts/post-a/city-a.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
